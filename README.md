# nevi_melanoma
Transcriptional markers of malignant melanocytes 
   - (1) Identify genes expressed in PRAME-negative malignant melanocytes using single-cell RNA-sequencing data (GSE72056)
   - (2) Identify subset of (1) upregulated in melanomas compared to benign nevi (GSE112509)
   - (3) Filter (2) for genes with high protein expression in normal melanocytes, keratinocytes (Uhl√©n M et al. Tissue-based map of the human proteome. Science (2015))
